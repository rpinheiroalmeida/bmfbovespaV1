A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far, away...

A vast sea of stars serves as the backdrop for the main title.
War drums echo through the heavens as a rollup slowly crawls
into infinity.

     It is a period of civil war. Rebel spaceships,
     striking from a hidden base, have won their first
     victory against the evil Galactic Empire.

     During the battle, Rebel spies managed to steal
     secret plans to the Empire's ultimate weapon, the
     Death Star, an armored space station with enough
     power to destroy an entire planet.

     Pursued by the Empire's sinister agents, Princess
     Leia races home aboard her starship, custodian of
     the stolen plans that can save her people and
     restore freedom to the galaxy...

The awesome yellow planet of Tatooine emerges from a total
eclipse, her two moons glowing against the darkness. A tiny
silver spacecraft, a Rebel Blockade Runner firing lasers
from the back of the ship, races through space. It is pursed
by a giant Imperial Stardestroyer. Hundreds of deadly
laserbolts streak from the Imperial Stardestroyer, causing
the main solar fin of the Rebel craft to disintegrate.

INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - MAIN PASSAGEWAY

An explosion rocks the ship as two robots, Artoo-Detoo (R2-
D2) and See-Threepio (C-3PO) struggle to make their way
through the shaking, bouncing passageway. Both robots are
old and battered. Artoo is a short, claw-armed tripod. His
face is a mass of computer lights surrounding a radar eye.
Threepio, on the other hand, is a tall, slender robot of
human proportions. He has a gleaming bronze-like metallic
surface of an Art Deco design.

Another blast shakes them as they struggle along their way.

                      THREEPIO
          We're doomed!

The little R2 unit makes a series of electronic sounds that
only another robot could understand.

                      THREEPIO
          There'll be no escape for the Princess
          this time.

Artoo continues making beeping sounds. Tension mounts as
loud metallic latches clank and the scream of heavy equipment
are heard moving around the outside hull of the ship.

                      THREEPIO
          What's that?

INT. MAIN HANGAR DECK - LUKE'S SHIP

Luke, Leia, and Dodonna meet under a huge space fighter.

                      LEIA
          What's wrong?

                      LUKE
          Oh, it's Han! I don't know, I really
          thought he'd change his mind.

                      LEIA
          He's got to follow his own path.

                      LUKE
          I only wish Ben were here.

Leia gives Luke a little kiss, turns, and goes off. As Luke
heads for his ship, another pilot rushes up to him and grabs
his arm.

                      BIGGS
          Luke! I don't believe it! How'd you
          get here... are you going out with
          us?!

                      LUKE
          Biggs! Of course, have I got some
          stories to tell...

Red Leader, a rugged handsome man in his forties, comes up
behind Luke and Biggs. He has the confident smile of a born
leader.

                      RED LEADER
          Are you... Luke Skywalker? Have you
          been checked out on the Incom T-sixty-
          five?

                      BIGGS
          Sir, Luke is the best bushpilot in
          the outer rim territories.

Red Leader pats Luke on the back as they stop in front of
his fighter.

                      RED LEADER
          I met your father once when I was
          just a boy, he was a great pilot.

                      LUKE
          Thank you, sir. I'll try.

Red Leader hurries to his own ship.

                      BIGGS
          I've got to get aboard.

                      LUKE
          I told you I'd make it someday, Biggs.

                      BIGGS
               (going off)
          You did, all right.

Luke laughs and shakes his head in agreement. He heads for
his ship.

As Luke begins to climb up the ladder into his sleek, deadly
spaceship, the crew chief, who is working on the craft, points
to little Artoo, who is being hoisted into a socket on the
back of the fighter.

                      CHIEF
          This R2 unit of your seems a bit
          beat up. Do you want a new one?

                      LUKE
          Not on your life!
               (to Artoo)
          You okay, Artoo?

The crewmen lower Artoo-Detoo into the craft. Now a part of
the exterior shell of the starship, the little droid beeps
that he is fine.

Luke climbs up into the cockpit of his fighter and puts an
his helmet. Threepio looks on from the floor of the massive
hangar as the crewmen secure his little electronic partner
into Luke's X-wing. It's an emotional-filled moment as Artoo
beeps good-bye.

                      CHIEF
          Okay, easy she goes!

                      THREEPIO
          Hang on tight,Artoo, you've got to
          come back.

Artoo beeps in agreement.

                      THREEPIO
          You wouldn't want my life to get
          boring, would you?

Artoo whistles his reply.

All final preparations are made for the approaching battle.
The hangar is buzzing with the last minute activity as the
pilots and crewmen alike make their final adjustments. The
hum of activity is occasionally trespassed by the distorted
voice of the loudspeaker issuing commands. Coupling hoses
are disconnected from the ships as they are fueled. Cockpit
shields roll smoothly into place over each pilot. A signalman,
holding red guiding lights, directs the ships. Luke, a trace
of a smile gracing his lips, peers about through his goggles.

                      BEN'S VOICE
          Luke, the Force will be with you.

Luke is confused at the voice and taps his headphones.

EXT. MASSASSI OUTPOST - JUNGLE

All that can be seen of the fortress is a lone guard standing
on a small pedestal jutting out above the dense jungle. The
muted gruesome crying sounds that naturally permeate this
eerie purgatory are overwhelmed by the thundering din of ion
rockets as four silver starships catapult from the foliage
in a tight formation and disappears into the morning cloud
cover.

END CREDITS OVER STARS
